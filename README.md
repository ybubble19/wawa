#Wawa Cloud Engineer Exercise

#	A template which deploys a webserver, hosting a single static page. Can be written in your IAC tool of choice.

# Requirements: 
# The template must deploy all resources required. Assume this will be deployed in a brand new account.
# Network traffic logs must be enabled
# Must use a server. Cannot use S3 (though this would be a great use case for it ÔÅä)
# The server cannot be in a public subnet
# You must deploy the webserver through the template. NO MANUAL STEPS!
# The web server can only be access from a single public IP address (55.55.55.55)

# A script which will deploy the template via the CLI. (Bash or Powershell are acceptable)
